# pike dataset

This data sets comes from Cucherousset et al. (2013).

## Format

pike is an object of class dataframe composed of 58 observations of 10
variables.

- trophic_status_initial:

  Initial trophic status at release

- ID:

  ID used for each individual by Cucherousset et al. (2013)

- Time:

  Time of the stable isotope measurement: 1 (Release) or 2 (Departure)

- Time_L:

  Time of the stable isotope measurement as string, either 'Release' or
  'Departure'

- Date:

  Date of release (common for all individuals) or recapture (variable
  dependind of the date of departure)

- Size_mm:

  Size (length) of juvenile pike, in mm

- d13C:

  delta 13C values

- d15N:

  delta 15N values

- Residence_time:

  Number of days between the release and the recapture

- Trophic_status_final:

  Trophic status at the end of the study

## Details

Briefly, Cucherousset et al. (2013) released 192 individually tagged,
hatchery-raised, juvenile pike (Esox lucius L.) with variable initial
trophic position (fin delta 13C/delta 15N values). Based on delta
values, individuals were classified into zooplanktivorous (delta 15N \<
10 ‰) and piscivorous (delta 15N \> 10 ‰) as cannibalism is commonly
observed in this species. Individuals were released in a temporarily
flooded grassland where pike eggs usually hatch of the Brière marsh
(France) to identify the determinants of juvenile natal departure. The
release site was connected through a unique point to an adjacent pond
used as a nursery habitat. Fish were continuously recaptured when
migrating from flooded grassland to adjacent pond. Recaptured
individuals (n = 29) were anaesthetized, checked for tags, measured for
fork length, fin-clipped to quantify changes in delta 13C and delta 15N
values, and released.
