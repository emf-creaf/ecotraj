# Avoca permanent plot dataset

Example dataset with data from 8 permanent forest plots located on
slopes of a valley in the New Zealand Alps. The study area is
mountainous and centered on the Craigieburn Range (Southern Alps), South
Island, New Zealand. Forests plots are almost monospecific, being the
mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides) the main dominant tree
species. Previously forests consisted of largely mature stands, but some
of them were affected by different disturbances during the sampling
period (1972-2009) which includes 9 surveys.

## Format

Three data items are included:

- avoca_strat:

  An object of class `stratifiedvegdata` (see function `stratifyvegdata`
  from package 'vegclust') with structural and compositional data.

- avoca_sites:

  A vector identifying sampled sites of each element in `avoca_strat`.

- avoca_surveys:

  A vector identifying surveys of each element in `avoca_strat`.
