## Details

Briefly, fur seals the Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and
subantarctic fur seal A. tropicalis whisker SI values yield unique
long-term information on individual behaviour which integrates the
spatial, trophic and temporal dimensions of the ecological niche. The
foraging strategies of this two species of sympatric fur seals were
examined in the winter 2001/2002 at Crozet, Amsterdam and Kerguelen
Islands (Southern Ocean) using the stable isotope values of serially
sampled whiskers. The subset of the initial data set is composed of
consecutive whisker sections (3 mm-long) starting from the proximal
(facial) end, with the most recently synthesized tissue remaining under
the skin. Only individuals (n = 47) with whiskers totalizing at least 30
sections were selected in the initail data, and only those 30 sections
were selected.
