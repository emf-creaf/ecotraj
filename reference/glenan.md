# Glenan dataset

Maerl bed data set to illustrate Ecological Quality Assessment (EQA)

## Format

Glenan is an object of class data.frame composed of 32 observations and
252 variables.

- Abundance.*x*:

  Abundance (number of individuals) of each taxon *x*

- Surveys:

  Indicates different Maerl bed surveys.

- Treatment:

  Combinations of fishing dredges and pressure levels. 'CTRL' stands for
  control. Fishing dredges are:

  - \(1\) a clam dredge (CD), 70 to 90 kg, 1.5 m wide, 40 teeth of 11 cm
    each;

  - \(2\) a queen scallop dredge (QSD), 120 kg,1.8 m wide, with a blade;

  - \(3\) a king scallop dredge (KSD), 190 kg, 1.8 m wide, 18 teeth of
    10 cm each every 9 cm.

## Details

Experimental data set built by Tauran et al. (2020) to study the impact
of fishing dredges and varying fishing pressures on maerl beds, in the
bay of Brest (Brittany, France).
